Slack bot

I am a lazy person, I admit. Everyday at work, we say god morning to each other in a Slack channel, and yes, I almost always forget. So I made this bot to do it. It also gives me the bus departure time from my bus stop from and to work. It can also show you the way to Kalops (a swedish meat stew) as an internal joke to the guy at work that couldn't shut up about me making a lunch bot for him. 

I have used Botkit for this bot, read more here https://github.com/howdyai/botkit. You need NPM. You also need Slack and a Slack token to run the bot, read more about it here https://api.slack.com/bot-users. 

To run the bot from command line:
* token= YOUR_TOKEN_HERE node slack_bot.js

Then invite the bot to your Slack channel :)
